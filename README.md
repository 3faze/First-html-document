	<h1>First HTML doc.</h1>
	<h3>HTML playground.</h3>
	<i>Here is some info :)</i>
	<p>
		I first started with scratch at age 11(or 10 idk :D), then i moved to construct 3 and I swear that i stayed in there for like 2 minutes then i got out.
	</p>
	<p>
		At age 11/12 i got to roblox studio(LUA scripting) because it was a platform that i always wanted to use.
		Nowadays im at python, javascript and as you can see im learning HTML too :D.<br>
		That was it, hope you liked it :)
